    <h2>Phase 1: Technical Documentation Generation</h2>
    <p>In this initial phase, the system generates a lean technical outline that serves as the backbone of your project.</p>

    <p>It creates core chapters—Introduction, System Architecture, Requirements, Testing Plan, and Summary—alongside any additional project-specific chapters based on your unique requirements.</p>

    <p>Each section is concise, focusing on high-level guidance rather than exhaustive detail.</p>

    <p>Please review and confirm that this structure matches your needs before proceeding.</p>
