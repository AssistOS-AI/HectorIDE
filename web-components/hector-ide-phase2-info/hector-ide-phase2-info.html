    <h2>Phase 2: Documentation Detailing and Customization</h2>

    <p>In this phase, the initial technical structure (generated in Phase 1) is processed to add detail and allow for customization.</p>

    <p>Here, you can modify the document as you see fit. If you provide specific instructions in the dedicated text field, the AI will rewrite the chapter content according to your requirements, using the overall document context.</p>

    <p>If you do not provide specific modifications, the system will detail the practical implementation of the project. It will automatically expand the concise summary of each chapter into a comprehensive description (minimum 300-400 characters), focusing on concrete implementation aspects.</p>

    <p>The result is a new and detailed document reflecting either the requested modifications or the automatic content elaboration.</p>
